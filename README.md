Renpy Live 2D Tutorial Source Code


Here is the source code for Renpy Live2D Tutorial.

Opening the script.rpy contains the actual format to display Live2D characters correctly in Renpy 7.4.0.

The only difference is you cannot customize or change the "Resources" folder to a different name. This causes errors when launching game.
It must be typed exactly it appears in the script.rpy that I wrote for Live 2D to work.

Any issues or bugs can be reported here in GitHub by clicking "issues."

Thank you.
